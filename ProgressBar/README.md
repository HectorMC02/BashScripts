#Progress Bar Script
This script allows you to set a specific time passed as a parameter for a
little bar which progresses during that time.
You must create a script doing something you want, then call this one.
The usage is, inside your own script:
	source progress_bar.sh <amount_of_time>
It does not need any dependences.
