#Progress Bar Script

This script allows you to set a specific time passed as a parameter for a bar which progresses during that time.

You must call this script in your own one has a function.

The usage is, inside your script:

	source progress_bar.sh <amount_of_time>

Both .sh files must be in the same folder (your script and progress_bar.sh).
It does not requires any dependences.
